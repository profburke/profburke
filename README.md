### Some highlights of my repos... 

Back in the day, every single Geocities page had an "Under Contstruction" image at the top (_I think it was required by law, usually they were wrapped in &lt;blink&gt; tags_). I won't place one here, but keep it in the back of your mind ...

The two most popular of my projects are: [AppLister] and [ilua].

*AppLister* is an iOS program that lists all the apps installed on your iPhone. Sadly, it hasn't worked in quite some time. Apple changed an API call from public to private, and RIP AppLister. I really ought to make the repo less prominent since it's pointless now, but I can't bring myself to do it. I had been working on some variations that would, for example, launch a randonly chosen game from all the ones you had installed.

*Ilua*, somewhat out of date, but the gist is there, was an example of how to make use of Lua from an iOS app. There are a number of reasons why you might want to do this such as providing built-in debugging or scripting tools, a "tweaks" mechanism, or feature toggles.

#### Blinking Lights

[luablink] is a library, written in Lua (_ok, that's a little obvious_) to control [Blink(1)] display lights from ThingM.
Although not limited to use with a Blink(1), [colorswatches], [morse], [luartttl] all are useful for working with them. 

#### Compilers and Interpreters

[Troll] is an implementation of a language for describing dice rolls; the related project, [troll-tools], is an alternate implementation using a bespoke virtual machine along with a byte compiler and a decompiler.

### Japanese üáØüáµ

Just a couple of items at the moment: [WanaKanaSwift], a Swift wrapper for a Javascript library that converts romaji into Âπ≥‰ªÆÂêç and Áâá‰ªÆÂêç; and [komapainter] - generate PNGs of Shogi pieces (_inspired by some Go code I stumbled across_).

#### Microcontrollers, etc.

A few miscellaneous projects using Arduino, ESP8266 and other microcontrollers include [cryptoticker], [microlife], and [nodelife].
